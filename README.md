## How to use

Add `.mixingcheck.yaml` to your project.

```yaml

  rules:
    - package: #2
        value: github.com/spf13/viper
      name:
        value: NewWithOptions
      type: call #3
    - package:
        value: github.com/ormanli/mixingcheck/internal/config
      name:
        value: Packages
      type: struct
github.com/ormanli/mixingcheck/internal: #4
  ignore_parent_rules: true #5
  rules:
    - package:
        value: regexp
      name:
        regex: true #6
        value: .*
      type: struct
```
1. Name of the package you want to execute rules.
2. The package that contains struct or function you want to check for rule match. 
3. Type is either struct or call.
4. It is possible to define additional rules for child packages.
